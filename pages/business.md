I offer business coaching to executives and those who are looking for career development.
I particularly specialise in coaching women in leadership and transformational coaching for those who are going through major change of any kind in their work.

We work together to develop goals that are sustainable through a programme of partnership which results in a clear way forward. 

I have supported a range of executives dealing with issues such as imposter syndrome, burnout and effective career transition in a variety of contexts.

> By suggesting small, practical steps and keeping tabs on my progress she has helped me to stick to my goals and achieve my plan.
