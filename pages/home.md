# Hello

Hello and welcome to Hilary Meyer Coaching.

I am a successful coach and leadership consultant, with over 30 years experience in senior leadership.
I understand the challenges of working in education, the health service and in business.

I have a certificate and diploma in coaching and mentoring from Oxford Brookes university and am accredited with the EMCC.
My approach to coaching is person-centred and I firmly believe that coaching is a vehicle to empower others so that they can achieve their goals.
Consequently, I work alongside my clients in their development to enable them in periods of change and growth to produce a sustainable outcome. 

Please feel free to contact me to discuss your coaching requirements and we can devise a programme that is suitable for you and/or your company.    

## Clients say of me

> Hilaryâ€™s willingness to connect with me, created a positive environment where I was able to acknowledge and then deal with my internal clutter, leading to a more satisfying life that uses my skills and talents.
